Integration of R and Tableau for analysis of titanic dataset
Knowledge model integration

Leveraging powerful statistical computation of data in R,
and combining it with best visualizations in Tableau.


KNN done in R
Integration using Rserve package to connect with Tableau
Enter a server name of “Localhost” (or “127.0.0.1”) and a port
of “6311”

Clustering analysis done in Tableau 
using calculated fields and parameters to connect with R

-----------

R functions and models can be invoked
through Tableau by creating calculated
fields.

Through this calculated field we can
dynamically invoke the R engine and
pass values to R.

The results would be returned back to
Tableau and used by Tableau
visualization engine.
